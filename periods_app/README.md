# Interview Challenge

I'm glad to be considered in the PREVIRED process, I hope you can enjoy my work, and if you have any questions you can call me, or an email would be easier.

I take the followings technologies for the challenge:

- Flask
- Flask Rest-Plus
- Docker
- Docker-Compose

Besides, you doesn't need nothing more that docker for this. I dockerized your API and with docker-compose, so it's everything assembled in one package. The container architecture is the new and the good, so we need to feel comfortable with containers, and CI/CD auto deploys.

I chose Flask, even when i know Django better, because the API in this test was small, and to use Flask is more accurated because in the future you can contain it in a docker container and put it in Kubernetes or something. To Use Django for something so small is not optimum. I dockerized the flask API in a dev server, because the challenge is not about the better production server or more accurated. However, it's functional and i recommend to use UWSGI for a production server.

# Get Started

To use this app, you need to install in your SO docker and docker-compose, i won't put a tutorial because are many installation cases, and the info always need to be good ordered and factorized for next projects, so a Docker/Docker-Compose installation for any SO would need to be in Confluence or a Wiki,

```sh
$ docker-compose build
$ docker-compose up
```

Finally, i hope to be part of Previred team, i'm young (or young enough haha), i want to achieve so much yet, however, i appreciate so much a team to talk with, about anything, because your job is your second life.

I hope we could celebrate together, see ya!
